inquiries related to product information and purchase assistance.
‚Ä¢ Example Scenario: A customer looking for a new smartphone interacts with the AI shopping 
companion, providing their preferences for screen size, camera quality, and budget, and 
receives personalized recommendations that meet their needs. The assistant also answers 
questions about specific phone features, compares prices from different retailers, and 
helps the customer complete the purchase. 
 Here's how you can approach this AI Shopping Companion use case with a project mindset, using Azure services step-by-step.
 I‚Äôll break it into key phases and include example code and integration ideas to help you get started.
üöÄ Step-by-Step Project Blueprint: AI Shopping Companion
üß© 1. Define Your Use Case & Data Sources
Example: Assist customers in finding smartphones based on their preferences (e.g., screen size, camera quality, budget).
‚Ä¢	Data Sources:
o	Product catalog (stored in a SQL or CosmosDB)
o	Customer data (via CDP or CRM)
o	Browsing history (web tracking)
o	Inventory & pricing (via E-commerce APIs)
üîß Sample Architecture and flow chart:

Frontend App
   ‚Üì
Azure App Services
   ‚Üì
Azure SQL / CosmosDB ‚Üê‚Üí Azure Blob (Product Images, PDFs)
   ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
Azure Data Factory       Static Assets
   ‚Üì
Azure Data Lake (raw/staged parquet/csv data)
   ‚Üì
Azure Synapse Analytics / Azure Databricks (data transformation, ML model training)
   ‚Üì
Azure Machine Learning (model registry, deployment)
   ‚Üì
Azure OpenAI / Azure Cognitive Services (product Q&A, recommendation engine)
   ‚Üì
Azure Bot Service / Web Chat Widget (AI Shopping Assistant)
 

üîç Explanation of Additional Components:
‚Ä¢	Azure Data Factory: Moves and transforms product catalog, PO data, and inventory logs from SQL/CosmosDB ‚Üí ADLS.
‚Ä¢	Azure Synapse / Databricks: Used for advanced analytics ‚Äî identify demand patterns, stockouts, and supplier performance.
‚Ä¢	Azure Machine Learning: Trains models like demand forecasting, delivery prediction, anomaly detection.
‚Ä¢	Azure OpenAI Service: Powers natural language features like chatbot Q&A for product info or voice agents for order status.
‚Ä¢	Azure Cognitive Services: Adds vision (image tagging), speech (voice interface), and personalization (recommendations).
‚Ä¢	Azure Bot Service: Integrates the AI assistant with customer-facing channels (website, Teams, WhatsApp).

2. Conversational Layer (Azure OpenAI + Bot Service)
‚Ä¢	a. GPT-4 Prompting Logic (Azure OpenAI)

import openai
openai.api_key = "your_azure_openai_key"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  engine="gpt-4",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a shopping assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm looking for a phone with a great camera under $600."}
  ]
)
print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])

b. Deploy with Azure Bot Framework
‚Ä¢	Use Azure Bot Service + Web Chat to embed on a website or app.
‚Ä¢	Integrate with Teams, Slack, WhatsApp using Bot Channels.

üìä 3. AI-Powered Recommendations (Azure Cognitive Services)
Use the Personalizer API or Recommendations API:
{
  "contextFeatures": [{"userPreferences": "camera, budget"}],
  "actions": [
    {"id": "phone_101", "features": [{"price": 599, "camera": "108MP"}]},
    {"id": "phone_102", "features": [{"price": 650, "camera": "64MP"}]}
  ]
}

This helps tailor product suggestions dynamically.
üîó 4. E-commerce Integration
‚Ä¢	Use REST APIs or SDKs to fetch real-time:
o	Product info

o	Reviews
o	Price comparisons
import requests

def get_product_info(product_id):
    url = f"https://api.myecommerce.com/products/{product_id}"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"}
    return requests.get(url, headers=headers).json()
üß† 5. Customer Data Insights (Customer Data Platform + Synapse)

    zoom: 10,
    authOptions: {
        authType: 'subscriptionKey',
        subscriptionKey: 'Your_Azure_Maps_Key'
